# Day-02 Javascript By sumon barai

## Variable

In programming, a variable is like a container that stores data with a name. So you can use and manipulate it later.

- two parts of a variable
  - variable name or variable identifier
  - variable value or variable data

## How to create a variable

- JavaScript variables can be **declared** in 4 ways:
- Modern JavaScript
  - Using let
  - Using const
- Older JavaScript
  - Using var
  - Automatically (Not Recommended)

## How to comment JS code

- single line comments
- multiline comments

## How to get output in js code

- innerHTML or innerText. (only browser runtime )
- document.write(). (only browser runtime )
- window.alert(). (only browser runtime )
- console.log(). (node and browser runtime )

## Variable Naming/identifier Rules

- Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
- Names must begin with a letter.
- Names can also begin with $ and \_ (but we will not use it in this tutorial).
- **Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables).**
- Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names.
- variable name best practice
  - use camelcase
  - human-readable
  - The name should be match the use cause
