## Loops and Iterations

- Loop: loop means one or more same tasks are repeatedly performed.

- We discussed 3 types of loops primarily
  - For Loop : when the iteration is fixed. example 10 time iteration
  - while Loop: when the iteration is not fixed, for example, I am not sure how many iterations occur
  - do while loop : when the iteration is not fixed, but one iteration must be done
- iteration - one loop is done is one iteration

## For Loop

<details>
<summary>For Loop Syntax</summary>

```javaScript
for (initialization; condition; update) {
  // code block to be executed
}

```

</details>

## Break and continue

- break : break stops the looping (stops all iteration) when JS sees the break statement
- continue: continue stops the current iteration when JS sees the continue statement

## while loop

<details>
<summary>For Loop Syntax</summary>

```javaScript
while (condition) {
  // Code block to be executed as long as the condition is true
}

```

</details>

## do while loop

<details>
<summary>do while loop Syntax</summary>

```javaScript
do {
  // code block to be executed
} while (condition);

```

</details>

## infinite loop

**When infinite loops are created:**

- Condition always evaluates to true
- The loop variable is not updated
- Wrong comparison or assignment instead of comparison
