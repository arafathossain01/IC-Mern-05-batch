# Day-01 Javascript By sumon barai

## what is javascript?

- JavaScript is a high-level, just-in-time compiled programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.
- JavaScript is a synchronous, blocking, single-threaded programming language
- **Synchronous**: code execution is line by line
- **Blocking:** No matter how long a previous process takes, the subsequent processes won't kick off until the former is completed.
- **Single-threaded.** A thread is simply a process that your JavaScript program can use to run a task.
  - Each thread can only do one task at a time.
  - JavaScript has just one thread, called the main thread, for executing any code.

## Javascript Runtime

- An environment that provides all the necessary components in order to use and run a JavaScript program
- Browser, NodeJS, and Bun are runtimes
- The browser is written in a low-level language like C, Rust, or other
- Node.js is primarily written in C++ language
- Bun is written in Zig language

## JavaScript Engine

- A program that converts JavaScript code we write into machine code that allows a computer to perform specific tasks
- Every browser has a built-in JavaScript engine
- Node.js uses Google's V8 engine that power's Chrome browser
- Bun uses JavaScriptCore (JSC), which is an open-source JavaScript engine developed by Apple for Safari

# two types of programming languages

- client-side language - JavaScript
- server-side language -
  - JavaScript (Node.js)
  - Python (Django, Flask, FastAPI)
  - PHP (Laravel, CodeIgniter, WordPress backend)
  - Java (Spring Boot, JSP, Servlets)
  - C# (ASP.NET Core)
  - Ruby (Ruby on Rails)
  - Go (Golang)
  - Rust
  - C++ (less common, but used in high-performance servers)

# Advantages of the JavaScript language

- web application
- mobile application
- desktop application
- moreâ€¦

# Software requirements for learning JavaScript

- Code editor or IDE ( VS Code editor )
- Runtime ( browser or Node.js)
- VS Code extension setup
